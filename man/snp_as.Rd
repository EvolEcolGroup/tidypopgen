\title{Compute the Pairwise Allele Sharing Matrix for a bigSNP object}
\usage{
snp_as(
  X,
  ind.row = bigstatsr::rows_along(X),
  ind.col = bigstatsr::cols_along(X),
  block.size = bigstatsr::block_size(nrow(X))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a \link[bigstatsr:FBM.code256-class]{bigstatsr::FBM.code256} matrix (as found in the \code{genotypes}
slot of a \link[bigsnpr:bigSNP-class]{bigsnpr::bigSNP} object).}

\item{ind.row}{An optional vector of the row indices that are used.
If not specified, all rows are used. Don't use negative indices.}

\item{ind.col}{An optional vector of the column indices that are used. If not
specified, all columns are used. Don't use negative indices.}

\item{block.size}{maximum number of columns read at once. Note that, to optimise the
speed of matrix operations, we have to store in memory 3 times the columns.}
}
\value{
a matrix of allele sharing between all pairs of individuals
}
\description{
This function computes the Allele Sharing matrix.
Estimates Allele Sharing (matching in \code{hierfstat})) between pairs of individuals
(for each locus, gives 1 if the two individuals are homozygous
for the same allele, 0 if they are homozygous for a different allele, and 1/2 if at least one individual
is heterozygous. Matching is the average of these 0, 1/2 and 1s)
