\usage{
gt_dapc(
  x,
  pop = NULL,
  n_pca = NULL,
  n_da = NULL,
  loci_details = TRUE,
  pca_info = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{gt_pca}, or its subclass \code{gt_pca_clust}}

\item{pop}{either a factor indicating the group membership of individuals;
or an integer defining the desired \emph{k} if x is a \code{gt_pca_clust}; or NULL, if
'x' is a \code{gt_pca_clust} and contain an element 'best_k',
usually generated with \code{\link[=gt_pca_clust_best_k]{gt_pca_clust_best_k()}},
which will be used to select the clustering level.}

\item{n_pca}{number of principal components to be used in the Discriminant
Analysis. If NULL, k-1 will be used.}

\item{n_da}{an integer indicating the number of axes retained in the
Discriminant Analysis step.}

\item{loci_details}{a logical indicating whether the loadings and contribution of loci should
be stored (TRUE, default) or
not (FALSE). Such output can be useful, but can also create
large matrices when there are a lot of loci and many dimensions.}

\item{pca_info}{a logical indicating whether information about the prior
PCA should be stored (TRUE, default) or not (FALSE). This information
is required to predict group membership of new individuals using predict,
but makes the object slightly bigger.}
}
\value{
an object of class \link[adegenet:dapc]{adegenet::dapc}
}
\description{
This function implements the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components
(DAPC, Jombart et al. 2010). This method descibes the diversity between
pre-defined groups. When groups are unknown, use \code{\link[=gt_pca_find_clusters]{gt_pca_find_clusters()}} to
infer genetic clusters. See 'details' section for a succint
description of the method, and the vignette in the package \code{adegenet}
("adegenet-dapc") for a
tutorial. This function returns objects of class \code{\link[adegenet:dapc]{adegenet::dapc}} which are compatible
with methods from \code{adegenet}; graphical methods for DAPC are documented in
\link[adegenet:dapcGraphics]{adegenet::scatter.dapc}
(see ?scatter.dapc).
}
\details{
The Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) is designed to
investigate the genetic structure of biological populations. This
multivariate method consists in a two-steps procedure. First, genetic
data are transformed (centred, possibly scaled) and submitted to a
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Second, principal components of
PCA are submitted to a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). A trivial matrix
operation allows to express discriminant functions as linear combination
of alleles, therefore allowing one to compute allele contributions. More
details about the computation of DAPC are to be found in the indicated reference.
