\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{gt_pca}}

\item{type}{the type of plot (one of "screeplot", "scores" and "loadings")}

\item{k}{the principal components to be plotted: for scores, a pair of values
e.g. c(1,2); for \code{loadings} either one or more values.}

\item{...}{not currently used.}
}
\value{
a \code{ggplot2} object

a \code{ggplot2} object
}
\description{
This function produces simple plots to quickly inspect an object. They are
not customisable; we recommend that you use \code{ggplot2} to produce publication
ready plots. For \code{gt_dapc}, the following types of plots are available:
\itemize{
\item \code{screeplot}: a plot of the eigenvalues of the discriminant axes
\item \code{scores} a scatterplot of the scores of each individual on two discriminant
axes (defined by \code{da})
\item \code{loadings} a plot of loadings of all loci for a discriminant axis (chosen with \code{da})
}

\itemize{
\item \code{screeplot}: a plot of the eigenvalues of the principal components (currently
it plots the singular value)
\item \code{scores} a scatterplot of the scores of each individual on two principal
components (defined by \code{pc})
\item \code{loadings} a plot of loadings of all loci for a given component (chosen with \code{pc})
