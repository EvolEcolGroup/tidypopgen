\title{Principal Component Analysis for \code{gen_tibble} objects}
\description{
There are a number of PCA methods available for \code{gen_tibble} objects. They
are mostly designed to work on very large datasets, so they only compute
a limited number of components. For smaller datasets, \code{gt_partialSVD} allows
the use of partial (truncated) SVD to fit the PCA; this method is suitable when
the number of individuals is much smaller than the number of loci. For larger
dataset, \code{gt_randomSVD} is more appropriate. Finally, there is a method
specifically designed for dealing with LD in large datasets, \code{gt_autoSVD}.
Whilst this is arguably the best option, it is somewhat data hungry, and so
only suitable for very large datasets (hundreds of individuals with several hundred
thousands markers, or larger).

NOTE: using gt_pca_autoSVD with a small dataset will likely cause an error,
see man page for details.
