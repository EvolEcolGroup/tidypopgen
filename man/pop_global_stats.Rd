\title{Compute basic population global statistics}
\usage{
pop_global_stats(.x, by_locus = FALSE, n_cores = bigstatsr::nb_cores())
}
\arguments{
\item{.x}{a \code{\link{gen_tibble}} (usually grouped, as obtained by using
\code{\link[dplyr:group_by]{dplyr::group_by()}}; use on a single population will return a number of
quantities as NA/NaN)}

\item{by_locus}{boolean, determining whether the statistics should be
returned by locus(TRUE), or as a single genome wide value (FALSE, the
default).}

\item{n_cores}{number of cores to be used, it defaults to
\code{\link[bigstatsr:reexports]{bigstatsr::nb_cores()}}}
}
\value{
a tibble of population statistics, with populations as rows and
statistics as columns
}
\description{
This function computes basic population global statistics, following the
notation in Nei 1987 (which in turn is based on Nei and Chesser 1983):
\itemize{
\item observed heterozygosity ( \eqn{\hat{h}_o}, column header \code{Ho})
\item expected heterozygosity, also known as gene diversity
( \eqn{\hat{h}_s}, \code{Hs})
\item total heterozygosity ( \eqn{\hat{h}_t}, \code{Ht})
\item genetic differentiation between subpopulations (\eqn{D_{st}}, \code{Dst})
\item corrected total population diversity (\eqn{h'_t}, \code{Htp})
\item corrected genetic differentiation between subpopulations
(\eqn{D'_{st}}, \code{Dstp})
\item \eqn{\hat{F}_{ST}} (column header, \code{Fst})
\item corrected \eqn{\hat{F'}_{ST}} (column header \code{Fstp})
\item \eqn{\hat{F}_{IS}} (column header, \code{Fis})
\item Jost's \eqn{\hat{D}} (column header, \code{Dest})
}
}
\details{
We use the notation of Nei 1987. That notation was for loci with
\eqn{m} alleles, but in our case we only have two alleles, so \code{m=2}.
\itemize{
\item Within population observed heterozygosity \eqn{\hat{h}_o} for a locus with
\eqn{m} alleles is defined as:\cr
\eqn{\hat{h}_o= 1-\sum_{k=1}^{s} \sum_{i=1}^{m}  \hat{X}_{kii}/s}\cr
where\cr \eqn{\hat{X}_{kii}} represents the proportion of homozygote
\eqn{i} in the sample for the \eqn{k}th population and\cr \eqn{s} the
number of populations,\cr following equation 7.38 in Nei(1987) on
pp.164.\cr
\item Within population expected heterozygosity (gene diversity)
\eqn{\hat{h}_s} for a locus with \eqn{m} alleles is defined as:\cr
\eqn{\hat{h}_s=(\tilde{n}/(\tilde{n}-1))[1-\sum_{i=1}^{m}\bar{\hat{x}_i^2}-\hat{h}_o/2\tilde{n}]}\cr #nolint
where \cr \eqn{\tilde{n}=s/\sum_k 1/n_k} (i.e the harmonic mean of
\eqn{n_k}) and\cr \eqn{\bar{\hat{x}_i^2}=\sum_k \hat{x}_{ki}^2/s}\cr
following equation 7.39 in Nei(1987) on pp.164.
\item Total heterozygosity (total gene diversity)
\eqn{\hat{h}_t} for a locus with \eqn{m} alleles is defined as:\cr
\eqn{\hat{h}_t = 1-\sum_{i=1}^{m} \bar{\hat{x}_i^2} +
  \hat{h}_s/(\tilde{n}s) - \hat{h}_o/(2\tilde{n}s)}\cr where \cr
\eqn{\hat{x}_i=\sum_k \hat{x}_{ki}/s}\cr following equation 7.40 in
Nei(1987) on pp.164.\cr
\item The amount of gene diversity among samples \eqn{D_{ST}} is defined as:\cr
\eqn{D_{ST} = \hat{h}_t - \hat{h}_s}\cr following the equation provided in
the text at the top of page 165 in Nei(1987).
\item The corrected amount of gene diversity among samples
\eqn{D'_{ST}} is defined as:\cr
\eqn{D'_{ST} = (s/(s-1))D'_{ST}}\cr following the equation provided in the
text at the top of page 165 in Nei(1987).
\item Total corrected heterozygosity (total gene diversity)
\eqn{\hat{h}_t} is defined as:\cr
\eqn{\hat{h'}_t = \hat{h}_s + D'_{ST}}\cr following the equation provided
in the text at the top of page 165 in Nei(1987).
\item \eqn{\hat{F}_{IS}} is defined as:\cr
\eqn{\hat{F}_{IS} = 1 - \hat{h}_o/\hat{h}_s}\cr following equation 7.41 in
Nei(1987) on pp.164.\cr
\item \eqn{\hat{F}_{ST}} is defined as:\cr
\eqn{\hat{F}_{ST} = 1 - \hat{h}_s/\hat{h}_t = D_{ST}/\hat{h}_t}\cr
following equation 7.43 in Nei(1987) on pp.165.\cr
\item \eqn{\hat{F'}_{ST}} is defined as:\cr
\eqn{\hat{F'}_{ST} = D'_{ST}/\hat{h'}_t}\cr following the explanation
provided in the text at the top of page 165 in Nei(1987).
\item Jost's \eqn{\hat{D}} is defined as:\cr
\eqn{\hat{D} = (s/(s-1))((\hat{h'}_t-\hat{h}_s)/(1-\hat{h}_s))}\cr as
defined by Jost(2008)

All these statistics are first computed by locus, and then averaged across
loci (including any monomorphic locus) to obtain genome-wide values. The
function uses the same algorithm as \code{hierfstat::basic.stats()} but is
optimized for speed and memory usage.
