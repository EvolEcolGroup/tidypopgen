\title{Compute pairwise population Fst}
\usage{
pairwise_pop_fst(.x, by_locus = FALSE, method = c("Hudson", "Nei87"))
}
\arguments{
\item{.x}{a grouped \code{\link{gen_tibble}} (as obtained by using \code{\link[dplyr:group_by]{dplyr::group_by()}})}

\item{by_locus}{boolean, determining whether Fst should be returned by locus(TRUE),
or as a single genome wide value obtained by taking the ratio of the mean numerator
and denominator (FALSE, the default).}

\item{method}{one of 'Hudson', 'Nei86', 'Nei87', and 'WC84'}
}
\value{
a tibble of genome-wide pairwise Fst values with each pairwise combination
as a row if "by_locus=FALSE", else
a list including the tibble of genome-wide values as well as a matrix with pairwise
Fst by locus with loci as rows and and pairwise
combinations as columns.
a matrix
}
\description{
This function computes pairwise Fst. The following methods are implemented:
\itemize{
\item 'Hudson': Hudson's formulation, as derived in Bhatia et al (2013) for diploids.
\item 'Nei86' : Gst according to Nei (1986), as derived in Bhatia et al (2013) for diploids.
\item 'Nei87': Fst according to Nei (1987) - this is equivalent to \code{hierfstat::pairwise.neifst()}
\item 'WC84' : Weir adn Cockerham (1984), as derived in Bhatia et al (2013) for diploids.
}
}
\details{
For all formulae, the genome wide estimate is obtained by taking the ratio of the mean
numerators and denominators over all relevant SNPs.
