# create a method is_diploid working on SNPbin and on list of SNPbin
# many statistics only make sense on diploid organisms
# hierfstat has very clear description of statistics on dosage data
# with explicit formulae

# Also look at package fst4pg
# And paper Estimating and interpresting Fst:The impact of rare variants advocating
# Hudson Fst

# Think about broom tidiers for various analysis
# https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/develop/broom/

# Look at
# https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/statistics/k-means/
# for a good example on k-means clustering (which is available from adegenet)

# For PCA, look at:

# https://clauswilke.com/blog/2020/09/07/pca-tidyverse-style/
# and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggbiplot/ggbiplot.pdf
# for plotting dudi.pca
# And some ideas from factorextra (not fully tidy, but some interesting ideas)
