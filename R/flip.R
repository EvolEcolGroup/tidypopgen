#' Flip the strand of alleles
#'
#' This function takes a vector of bases and recodes them.
#'
#' Note that it does not check that all bases are valid. Also, missing alleles
#' "m" are kept as "m".
#'
#' @param bases a vector of characters. The only valid characters are "A", "T",
#' "C" and "G".
#' @returns a vector of recoded bases
#' @keywords internal
