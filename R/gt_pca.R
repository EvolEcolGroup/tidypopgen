#' Principal Component Analysis for `gen_tibble` objects
#'
#' There are a number of PCA methods available for `gen_tibble` objects. They
#' are mostly designed to work on very large datasets, so they only compute
#' a limited number of components. For smaller datasets, `gt_partialSVD` allows
#' the use of partial (truncated) SVD to fit the PCA; this method is suitable when
#' the number of individuals is much smaller than the number of loci. For larger
#' dataset, `gt_randomSVD` is more appropriate. Finally, there is a method
#' specifically designed for dealing with LD in large datasets, `gt_autoSVD`.
#' Whilst this is arguably the best option, it is somewhat data hungry, and so
#' only suitable for very large datasets (hundreds of individuals with several hundred
#' thousands markers, or larger).
#'
#' NOTE: using gt_pca_autoSVD with a small dataset will likely cause an error,
#' see man page for details.
#'
#' NOTE: monomorphic markers must be removed before PCA is computed. The error
#' message 'Error: some variables have zero scaling; remove them before attempting
#' to scale.' indicates that monomorphic markers are present.
