#' Load a gen_tibble
#'
#' Load a `gen_tibble` previously saved with [gt_save()]. If the *.rds* and
#'  *.bk* files have not
#' been moved, they should be found automatically. If they were moved, use
#' `reattach_to` to point to the *.rds* file (the *.bk* file needs to be in the
#' same directory as the *.rds* file).
#'
#' @param file the file name, including the full path. If it does not end with
#'   *.gt*, the extension will be added.
#' @param reattach_to the file name, including the full path, of the *.rds* file
#'   if it was moved. It assumes that the *.bk* file is found in the same path.
#'   You should be able to leave this to NULL unless you have moved the files.
#' @returns a [`gen_tibble`]
#' @seealso [gt_save()]
